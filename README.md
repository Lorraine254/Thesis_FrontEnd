Spatial Hypothesis Test:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): PM2.5 concentrations are randomly distributed across space.
Alternative (H₁): PM2.5 concentrations show statistically significant clustering (hotspots or coldspots).

The Getis-Ord Gi statistic* was used to test this hypothesis, which identified, 3 statistically significant hotspots.
